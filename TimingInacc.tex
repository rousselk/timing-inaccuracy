\section{COOJA and MSPSim}

Provided by the Contiki OS project~\cite{ContikiOS}, the COOJA network
simulator~\cite{Cooja} has become a widely used tool in the domain of
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The research community especially uses
it extensively to perform simulations of small to relatively large wireless
networks of connected devices embedding sensors and/or actuators, commonly
named \emph{``motes''}, and thus to develop, debug and evaluate projects
based in the WSN technology.

COOJA itself is a Java-based application, providing three main features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a graphical user interface (GUI, based on Java's standard Swing toolkit)
to design, run, and analyze WSN simulations;
\item simulation of the radio medium underlying the wireless communications
of sensor networks;
\item an extensible framework, which allows integration of external tools
to provide additional features to the COOJA application.
\end{enumerate}
This last feature is used to allow COOJA to actually emulate the various
motes constituting the WSNs. It indeed embeds and uses dedicated emulator
programs that perform cycle-exact emulation of the chips with which motes
are built: microcontroller units (MCUs), radio transceivers, etc.

This emulation mechanism is one of the main strong points of COOJA:
thanks to it, very fine-grained, precise and low-level simulations
can be performed; this is why COOJA has become a tool of choice especially
for debugging and evaluating WSN-related software (which happens to be
often based on Contiki OS).

Current versions of COOJA make use of two different emulator software
packages: Avrora for emulation of Atmel AVR-based devices, and
MSPSim~\cite{MSPSim} for emulation of TI MSP430-based devices.

Of these two emulators, MSPSim is currently the most used in literature
including COOJA-based simulations, since motes based on MSP430 MCUs are
more commonly distributed and used: we can especially think to the pervasive
TelosB/SkyMote family, or to Zolertia's Z1 platform.

\section{Timing Inaccuracy Problem in MSPSim}

When performing our own simulations with virtual networks of MSP430-based
motes, we noticed timing inaccuracies in comparison to experiences made
on actual hardware. More precisely, we noticed that our simulations showed
unexplained delays during packet transmission (TX) over the radio medium,
that weren't observed during similar experiences on physical motes.
We then investigated the problem, and discovered the following results.

The problem concerns the emulation of the TI ChipCon CC2420 radio
transceiver by the MSPSim software package.

The differences appear on one precise operation: when loading packet data
into the transmission (TX) buffer of the emulated radio transceiver.
MSPSim, when emulating the CC2420 transceiver, performs TX buffer loading
much more slowly than the physical CC2420 chip actually does.

A simple example program, which only role is to load a huge packet
(110 bytes, that is: near the maximum size for IEEE
802.15.4\footnotemark[1] data packets) compiled for and run on
Zolertia Z1 hardware platform, clearly shows this timing difference.
The results of the comparison between execution on a simulted Z1 mote
in COOJA/MSPSim and on physical Z1 hardware is shown in Table
\ref{TblTXPktLoadDelays} hereafter.

\footnotetext[1]{IEEE 802.15.4 is the standard defining the physical
(PHY) layer that the involved CC2420 radio transceiver---as well as
many others---communicates on.}

\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
Operating System / SPI Driver &  Cooja Sim.  & Hardware Test \\
\hline
RIOT OS / Standard (Safe)     &   89 ticks   &  32 ticks \\ 
RIOT OS / Fast SPI Write      &   36 ticks   &  14 ticks \\
Contiki OS / Fast SPI Write   &   14 ticks   &   7 ticks \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\small Delays observed for loading packets into CC2420 TX buffer,
using various software platforms and implementations.\\
Values are given in ``ticks'' of \texttt{rtimer/hwtimer}, both of these
timers incrementing at a rate of 32,768~Hz. The unit is thus a fixed period
of time equal to about 30.5 microseconds.}
\label{TblTXPktLoadDelays}
\end{table}

We thus see that the inaccuracy in timing for the TX buffer loading operation
is very important: simulated loading delay is 2 to 3 times larger than
actual delay on hardware!

Such a difference can be expected to have serious consequences on
the validity of evaluations made with COOJA simulations, more precisely
on time and performance evaluations.
